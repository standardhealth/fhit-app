# FHIT App

A web app for comparing FHIR Profiles using a FHIR Interoperability Table (FHIT).

**Note**: This app is in development and many features are not fully built yet.

## Development Environment Set Up

To run the project locally, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed on the user's system.

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The page auto-updates as you edit the files in `pages/`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
